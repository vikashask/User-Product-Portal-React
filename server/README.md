Create a User-Product portal

1. Landing page should have login screen : Login - A register user will login with his credentials Or user will sign up

2. Once a user login successfully, then

i.              user should be able to see list of the products on the landing page and also search for specific products.
ii.             user should be able to create new products
iii.            user should be able to edit or delete owned products.
iv.           user should be able to edit own details.
v.            user should be able to see other user details but cannot edit or delete
vi.           user should be able to see products created by other user but cannot edit or delete
              
3. Error Handling implementation for the above 

REST API (services) details:

CRUD operation for User

I.	create User
II.	list users
III.	get single user resource by Id
IV.	edit user
V.	delete user


CRUD operation for Advertisement

I.	create product
II.	list products
III.	get single product resource by Id
IV.	edit products
V.	delete products


Note: Feel free to add more services if needed.

Expectation from the candidate:

I.	Preferred solution would have the rest api implemention using nodeJs, KOA JS/ Express JS etc. or if that is not possible it can be mocked using the axios.
II.	The portal must be created using react, redux and thunk, Custom CSS / CSS framework, responsive design, and unit test cases covering all scenarios.
III.	Use all best practices (production level code quality).
IV.	Include README file.
